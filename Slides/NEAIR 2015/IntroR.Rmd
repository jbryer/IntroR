# Overview #####################################################################

## What is R?

"R is a language and environment for statistical computing and graphics. It is a GNU project which is similar to the S language and environment which was developed at Bell Laboratories (formerly AT&T, now Lucent Technologies) by John Chambers and colleagues..."

"R provides a wide variety of statistical (linear and non linear modeling, classical statistical tests, time-series analysis, classification, clustering, ...) and graphical techniques, and is highly extensible. The S language is often the vehicle of choice for research in statistical methodology, and R provides an Open Source route to participation in that activity."  
(R-project.org)


## Pros

>-  FREE!
	*R is available as Free Software under the terms of the Free Software Foundation's GNU General Public License in source code form. It compiles and runs on a wide variety of UNIX platforms and similar systems (including FreeBSD and Linux), Windows and MacOS.*
>-  Available for multiple platforms (i.e. Windows, Mac, Linux).
>-  Easily extensible with (currently) over 2,000 packages listed on CRAN.
>-  Scriptable.
>-  Publication grade graphics.
>-  Multiple ways of doing the same thing.
>-  Quickly becoming the *de facto* standard among statistician.

## Cons

>-  Has a steeper learning curve.
>-  Multiple ways of doing the same thing.
>-  Can have difficulty with *very* large datasets.

## R's Roots... S

* S is a language that was developed by John Chambers and others at Bell Labs.
* S was initiated in 1976 as an internal statistical analysis environment - originally implemented as Fortran libraries.
* Early versions of the language did not contain functions for statistical modeling.
* In 1988 the system was rewritten in C and began to resemble the system that we have today (this was Version 3 of the language). The book Statistical Models in S by Chambers and Hastie (the blue book) documents the statistical analysis functionality.
* Version 4 of the S language was released in 1998 and is the version we use today. The book Programming with Data by John Chambers (the green book) documents this version of the language.


## History of S

* In 1993 Bell Labs gave StatSci (now Insightful Corp.) an exclusive license to develop and sell the S language.
* In 2004 Insightful purchased the S language from Lucent for \$2 million and is the current owner.
* In 2006, Alcatel purchased Lucent Technologies and is now called Alcatel-Lucent.
* Insightful sells its implementation of the S language under the product name S-PLUS and has built a number of fancy features (GUIs, mostly) on top of it-hence the "PLUS".
* In 2008 Insightful is acquired by TIBCO for \$25 million; future of S-PLUS is uncertain.
* The S language itself has not changed dramatically since 1998.
* In 1998, S won the Association for Computing Machinery's Software System Award.


##  

In "Stages in the Evolution of S", John Chambers writes:

<blockquote>"[W]e wanted users to be able to begin in an interactive environment, where they did not consciously think of themselves as programming. Then as their needs became clearer and their sophistication increased, they should be able to slide gradually into programming, when the language and system aspects would become more important."
</blockquote>

## History of R 

* 1991: Created in New Zealand by Ross Ihaka and Robert Gentleman. Their experience developing R is documented in a 1996 JCGS paper.
* 1993: First announcement of R to the public.
* 1995: Martin M?achler convinces Ross and Robert to use the GNU General Public License to make R free software.
* 1996: A public mailing list is created (R-help and R-devel)
* 1997: The R Core Group is formed (containing some people associated with S-PLUS). The core group controls the source code for R.
* 2000: R version 1.0.0 is released.
* 2013: R version 3.0 is released on April 3, 2013.
* 2015: Current version of R is 3.2.2
* There are now over 7,000 packages listed on CRAN.

## Installing R

The latest version of R can be downloaded from [cran.r-project.org](http://cran.r-project.org). The current version of R is:

```{r}
R.version$version.string
```

You will also want to install [RStudio](http://rstudio.com).

Installation instructions are available here: [https://github.com/jbryer/IntroR/blob/master/Installation/Install.md](https://github.com/jbryer/IntroR/blob/master/Installation/Install.md)

To install the set of packages used for this workshop, run the following R command:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
source('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jbryer/IntroR/master/Installation/Setup.r')
```

## R as a Big Calculator

```{r}
2 + 2
1 + sin(9)
exp(1) ^ (1i * pi)
```

## Euler's Formula

## R Packages

One aspect that makes R popular is how (relatively) easy it is to extend it's functionality vis-à-vis R packages. R packages are collections of R functions, data, and documentation.

The Comprehensive R Archive Network ([CRAN](http://cran.r-project.org)) is the central repository where R packages are published. However, it should be noted that there are mirrors located across the globe.

Using packages requires two steps: first, install the package (required once per R installation); and second, load the package (once per R session).

```{r, eval=FALSE}
install.packages('likert')
```
```{r, message=FALSE}
library(likert)
```

## Installed and Loaded Packages

The `library()` function without any parameters will print all installed R packages whereas the `search()` function will list loaded packages (technically all available namespaces/environments, more on that later).

```{r}
library()
search()
```

## Github Packages

[Github](http://github.com) is an online source repository and has become a popular place for R package developers to store their R packages. The `devtools` R package, designed to help package developers, has a function, `install_github` that will install R packages from a Github repository.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
devtools::install_github('jbryer/likert')
```

## `ls()`

We can use the `ls()` function to determine what functions are available in a package.

```{r}
ls('package:likert')
```

## Getting Help

R provides extensive documentation and help. The help.start() function will launch a webpage with links to:
* The R manuals
* The R FAQ
* Search engine
* and many other useful sites

The help.search() function will search the help file for a particular word or phrase. For example:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
help.search('cross tabs')
```

To get documentation on a specific function, the `help()` function, or simply `?functionName` will open the documentation page in the web browser.

Lastly, to search the R mailing lists, use the `RSiteSearch()` function.

# Loading Data #################################################################

## Reading Data

Data File Type         | Extension  |  Function
-----------------------|------------|--------------------------------------------
R Data                 | rda, rdata | `base:load`
Comma separated values | csv        | `utils:read.csv`, `readr:read_csv`
Other delimited files  |            | `utils:read.table`, `readr:read_delim`
Tab separated files    |            | `readr:read_tsv`
Fixed width files      |            | `utils:read.fwf`, `readr:read_fwf`
SPSS                   | sav        | `foreign:read.spss`, `haven:read_sav`, `haven:read_por`
SAS                    | sas        | `haven:read_sas`
Read lines             |            | `base:scan`, `readr:read_lines`
Microsoft Excel        | xls, xlsx  | `gdata:read.xls`, `readxl:read_excel`
Qualtrics              | N/A        | `qualtrics:getSurveyResults`

## Reading Data from Databases

The `RODBC` package is the most common way to connect to a variety of databases. 

* `odbcConnect` - Open a connection to an ODBC database
* `sqlFetch`    - Read a table from an ODBC database into a data frame
* `sqlQuery`    - Submit a query to an ODBC database and return the results
* `close`       - Close the connection

Other packages used to connect to specific databases:

* MySQL      - `RMySQL`
* Oracle     - `ROracle`
* JDBC       - `RJDBC`
* SQLite     - `RSQLite`
* PostgreSQL - `RPosgreSQL`

## The `sqlutils` Package

The [`sqlutils`](https://github.com/jbryer/sqlutils) is designed to help manage many query files and facilitates documenting and parameterizing the queries.

```{r, message=FALSE}
library(sqlutils)
sqlPaths()
getQueries()
getParameters('StudentsInRange')
```


## Example SQL File (`StudentsInRange`)

```
#' Students enrolled within the given date range.
#' 
#' @param startDate the start of the date range to return students.
#' @default startDate format(Sys.Date(), '%Y-01-01')
#' @param endDate the end of the date range to return students.
#' @default endDate format(Sys.Date(), '%Y-%m-%d')
#' @return CreatedDate the date the row was added to the warehouse data.
#' @return StudentId the student id.
SELECT * 
FROM students 
WHERE CreatedDate >= ':startDate:' AND CreatedDate <= ':endDate:'
```

```{r}
sqldoc('StudentsInRange')
```

## Running Query

```{r, message=FALSE}
require(RSQLite)
sqlfile <- paste(system.file(package='sqlutils'), '/db/students.db', sep='')
m <- dbDriver("SQLite")
conn <- dbConnect(m, dbname=sqlfile)
q1 <- execQuery('StudentSummary', connection=conn)
head(q1)
```

## IPEDS Data

The `ipeds` R package provides an interface to download data file from IPEDS.

```{r, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
library(ipeds)
data(surveys)
unique(surveys$Survey)
head(surveys[,c('SurveyID','Title')])
```

## IPEDS Data

The `getIPEDSSurvey` and `ipedsHelp` are the most commonly used functions. The former will download and load the data into R (note data is cached and downloaded once per installation); the latter will provide the data dictionary for the given survey.

```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
directory = getIPEDSSurvey('HD', 2013)
admissions = getIPEDSSurvey("IC", 2013)
retention = getIPEDSSurvey("EFD", 2013)
```

```{r, eval=FALSE}
ipedsHelp('HD', 2013)
```

```{r}
head(directory)
```


# The R Language ###############################################################

## Arithmetic Operators

* `+` - addition
* `-` - subtraction
* `*` - multiplication
* `/` - division
* `^` or `**` - exponentiation
* `x %% y` - modulus (x mod y) 5%%2 is 1  
```{r}
5 %% 2
```
* `x %/% y` - integer division  
```{r}
5%/%2
```


## R Primitive Vectors

* `logicial` (e.g. `TRUE`, `FALSE`)
* `integer` - whole numbers, either positive or negative (e.g. `2112`, `42`, `-1`)
* `double` or `numeric` - real number (e.g. `0.05`, `pi`, `-Inf`, `NaN`)
* `complex` - complex number (e.g. `1i`)
* `character` - sequence of characters, or a string (e.g. `"Hello NEAIR!"`)

You can use the `class` function to determine the type of an object.

```{r}
tmp <- c(2112, pi)
class(tmp)
```

To test if an object is of a particular class, use the `is.XXX` set of functions:

```{r}
is.double(tmp)
```

And to convert from one type to another, use the `as.XXX` set of functions:

```{r}
as.character(tmp)
```

## Lists

A `list` is an object that contains a list of named values

```{r}
tmp <- list(a = 2112, b = pi, z = "Hello NEAIR!")
tmp
tmp[1]; class(tmp[1]) # One square backet: return a list
tmp[[1]]; class(tmp[[2]]) # Two square brackets: return as object at that position
```

## Factors

A `factor` is a way for R to store a nominal, or categorical, variable. R stores the underlying data as an integer where each value corresponds to a label.

```{r}
gender <- c(rep("male",4), rep("female", 6))
gender
gender <- factor(gender, levels=c('male','female','unknown')) 
gender
levels(gender)
```

## Factors can be ordered {.columns-2}

The `ordered` parameter indicates whether the levels in the factor should be ordered.

```{r}
data(tutoring, package='TriMatch')
head(tutoring$Grade)
grade <- tutoring$Grade
table(grade, useNA='ifany')
grade <- factor(tutoring$Grade,
		levels=0:4,
		labels=c('F','D','C','B','A'), 
		ordered=TRUE)
table(grade, useNA='ifany')
```

With an ordered factor, coercing it back to an integer will maintain the order, but the values start with one!

```{r}
head(grade)
table(as.integer(grade))
```

## Dates {.columns-2}

R stores dates in `YYYY-MM-DD` format. The `as.Date` function will convert characters to `Date`s if they are in that form. If not, the `format` can be specified to help R coerce it to a `Date` format.

```{r}
today <- Sys.Date()
format(today, '%B %d, $Y')
as.Date('2015-NOV-01', format='%Y-%b-%d')
```

* `%d` - day as a number (i.e 0-31)
* `%a` - abbreviated weekday (e.g. `Mon`)
* `%A` - unabbreviated weekday (e.g. `Monday`)
* `%m` - month (i.e. 00-12)
* `%b` - abbreviated month (e.g. `Jan`)
* `%B` - unabbreviated month (e.g. `January`)
* `%y` - 2-digit year (e.g. `15`)
* `%Y` - 4-digit year (e.g. `2015`)


## NA versus NULL

R is just as much a programming language as it is a statistical software package. As such it represents null differently for programming (using `NULL`) than for data (using `NA`).

* `NULL` represents the null object in R: it is a reserved word. NULL is often returned by expressions and functions whose values are undefined.

* `NA` is a logical constant of length 1 which contains a missing value indicator. `NA` can be freely coerced to any other vector type except raw. There are also constants `NA_integer` , `NA_real` , `NA_complex`, and `NA_character` of the other atomic vector types which support missing values: all of these are reserved words in the R language.

For more details, see http://opendatagroup.com/2010/04/25/r-na-v-null/

## Handling Missing Data

There are a number of functions available for finding and subsetting missing values:

* `is.na` - function that takes one parameter and returns a logical vector of the same length where `TRUE` indicates the value is missing in the original vector.
* `complete.cases` - function that takes a data frame or matrix and returns `TRUE` if the entire row has *no* missing values.
* `na.omit` - function that takes a data frame and matrix and returns a subset of that data frame or matrix with any rows containing missing values removed.

Many statistical functions (e.g. `mean`, `sd`, `cor`) have a `na.rm` parameter that, when `TRUE`, will remove any missing values before calculating the statistic.

There are two very good R packages for imputing missing values:

* [`mice`](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/mice/index.html) - [Multivariate Imputation by Chained Equations](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=3&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=0CDIQFjACahUKEwinhILMt-3IAhUCbSYKHYY9Bxc&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.jstatsoft.org%2Farticle%2Fview%2Fv045i03%2Fv45i03.pdf&usg=AFQjCNHzwk41fSeCTmRPowZFig2zPBTl8g&sig2=VyDV7NMsIZXdwP8jd0uaJA)
* [`Amelia II`](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/Amelia/index.html) - [A Program for Missing Data](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=6&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=0CE4QFjAFahUKEwjHn8aiuO3IAhWF8CYKHZzhABs&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.jstatsoft.org%2Farticle%2Fview%2Fv045i07&usg=AFQjCNE7Dn7a_YfAactbLSLRr3Fm3Rej2w&sig2=t5NWLZMkyf_8MpCjSHAYFg&bvm=bv.106379543,d.eWE)

## Example: Excel File with Multiple Sheets

```{r, message=FALSE}
library(gdata)
summer2014 <- read.xls('../../Data/MathAnxiety.xlsx', sheet=1)
fall2014 <- read.xls('../../Data/MathAnxiety.xlsx', sheet=2)
summer2015 <- read.xls('../../Data/MathAnxiety.xlsx', sheet=3)

summer2014$Term <- 'Summer 2014'
fall2014$Term <- 'Fall 2014'
summer2015$Term <- 'Summer 2015'

mass <- rbind(summer2014, fall2014, summer2015)
head(mass)
```

## Data Frames

Data frames are collection of vectors, thereby making them two dimensional. Unlike matrices (see `?matrix`) where all data elements are of the same type (i.e. numeric, character, logical, complex), each column in a data frame can be of a different type.

```{r}
class(mass)
dim(mass) # Dimension of the data frame (row by column)
nrow(mass) # Number of rows
ncol(mass) # Number of columns
```

## `str`

The `str` is perhaps the most useful function in R. It displays the structure of an R object.

```{r}
str(mass)
```

## Exploring the Data in Data Frames

```{r}
head(mass)
tail(mass, n=3)
```

The `View` function will provide a (read-only) spreadsheet view of the data frame.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
View(mass)
```

## Subsetting Data Frames

Using square brackets will allow you to subset from a data frame. The first parameter is for rows, the second for columns. Leaving one blank will return all rows or columns.

```{r}
mass[c(1:2,10),] # Return the first, second, and tenth row
mass[,2] # Return the second column
```

You can also subset columns using the dollar sign (`$`) notation.

```{r}
mass$q10
```

## Subsetting Missing Values

Using the `complete.cases` function, we can return rows with at least one missing values.

```{r}
mass[!complete.cases(mass),]
```

Using the `is.na`, we can change replace the missing values.

```{r}
(tmp <- sample(c(1:5, NA)))
tmp[is.na(tmp)] <- 2112
tmp
```

## Tip: One Column Data Frame

When selecting one column from a data frame, R will convert the returned object to a vector.

```{r}
class(mass[,1])
```

You can use the `drop=FALSE` parameter keep the subset as a data frame.

```{r}
class(mass[,1,drop=FALSE])
```

## Subsetting with Logical Operators

You can subset using logical vectors. For example, there are `r nrow(directory)` rows in the `directory` data frame loaded from IPEDS. You can pass a logical vector of length `r nrow(directory)` where `TRUE` indicates to return the row and `FALSE` to not. For example, we wish to return the row with Excelsior College:

```{r}
row <- directory$instnm == 'Excelsior College'
length(row)
```

Here we are using the `==` logical operator. This will test each element in the `directory$instnm` and return `TRUE` if it is equal to `Excelsior College`, `FALSE` otherwise.

```{r}
directory[row, 1:16] # Include only 16 columns for display purposes
```

## `which`

The `which` command will return an `integer` vector with the positions within the `logical` vector that are `TRUE`.

```{r}
which(row)
```

```{r}
directory[2783, 1:16]
```

## Logical Operators

* `!a` - TRUE if a is FALSE
* `a == b` - TRUE if a and be are equal
* `a != b` - TRUE if an and b are not equal
* `a > b` - TRUE if a is larger than b, but not equal
* `a >= b` - TRUE if a is larger or equal to b
* `a < b` - TRUE if a is smaller than be, but not equal
* `a <= b` - TRUE if a is smaller or equal to b
* `a %in% b` - TRUE if a is in b where b is a vector  
```{r}
which( letters %in% c('a','e','i','o','u') )
```
* `a | b` - TRUE if a *or* b are TRUE
* `a & b` - TRUE if a *and* b are TRUE
* `isTRUE(a)` - TRUE if a is TRUE

## Side Note: Operators are Functions

All operations (e.g. `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `[`, `<-`) are functions. 

```{r}
class(`+`)
`+`
`+`(2, 3)
```

You can redefine these functions, but probably not a good idea ;-)

## Sorting Data

The `order` function will take one or more vectors (usually in the form of a data frame) and return an integer vector indicating the new order. There are two parameters to adjust where `NA`s are placed (`na.last=FALSE`) and whether to sort in increasing or decreasing order (`decreasing=FALSE`).

```{r}
(randomLetters <- sample(letters))
randomLetters[order(randomLetters)]
randomLetters[order(randomLetters, decreasing=TRUE)]
```

## Reshaping Data (melting)

Data is often said to be in one of two formats: wide or long. The `mass` data frame is currently in a wide format where each variable is a separate column. However, there are certain analyses that will require the data to be in a long format. In a long format, we would have two columns to represent all the items (one for the item name, one for value), plus any additional identity variables. The `melt` command will convert a wide table to a long table.

```{r, message=FALSE, message=FALSE}
library(reshape2)
mass$Id <- 1:nrow(mass) # 59 rows
mass.melted <- melt(mass, id.vars=c('Id','Gender','Term'), variable.name='Item', value.name='Response')
head(mass.melted, n=4)
nrow(mass.melted)
```

## Reshaping Data (casting)

To convert a long table to a wide table, use the `dcast` function

```{r}
mass.casted <- dcast(mass.melted, Id + Gender + Term  ~ Item, value.var='Response')
head(mass.casted); nrow(mass.casted)
```

## Removing Columns

To remove a single column from a data frame, simply assign to `NULL` to the column value.

```{r}
mass$Id <- NULL
head(mass)
```

## `if` Statements

`if` statements are a way of doing different operations conditionally. In this example, the `sample` function returns either a 0 or 1.

```{r}
if(sample(c(0,1), 1) > 0.5) {
	print('heads')
} else {
	print('tails')
}
```

For simpler problems, the `ifelse` function may be easier.

```{r}
ifelse(sample(c(0,1), 1) > 0.5, 'heads', 'tails')
```


## `for` loops

The `for` loop allows you to do some operation a number of times. In this example, we wish to convert each of the Likert responses in the `mass` data frame to an ordered factor.

```{r}
for(i in 2:15) {
	mass[,i] <- factor(mass[,i], levels=1:5, labels=c('Strongly Disagree', 
			'Disagree', 'Neutral', 'Agree', 'Strongly Agree'), ordered=TRUE)
}
str(mass)
```

## `while` loops

`while` loops will run until some condition is met. In this example, consider 1=heads, 0=tails. How many random events would it take before getting 100 heads?

```{r}
sum <- 0
count <- 0
while(sum < 100) {
	sum <- sum + sample(c(0,1), 1)
	count <- count + 1
}
count # Number of loops until we got 100 head
```

## Functions

Functions allow for organizing common procedures to easily be used later. You can specify any number of parameters with optional default values. The objects created and/or edited within the function are local to the function (i.e . not available to the calling environment). The `return` or `invisible` function is used to return value(s) to the environment calling the function. The `invisible` function will return a value but will not print it to the console if it is not assigned to an object.

```{r}
getStanding <- function(credits, 
						breaks=c(30, 60, 90),
						labels=c('Freshman','Sophomore', 'Junior', 'Senior')) {
	results <- cut(credits, breaks=c(-Inf, breaks, Inf), labels=labels, 
				   include.lowest=TRUE, right=FALSE)
	return(results)
}
getStanding(42)
getStanding(c(27, 60, 101, 200))
```

## Renaming Columns

```{r}
names(mass) # Get the current names
items <- c('I find math interesting.',
		   'I get uptight during math tests.',

## Example: SAT and First Year Retention (subsetting)

In this example, we wish to explore the relationship between SAT scores and first year retention as measures at the institutional level. These data are part of the IPEDS data collection, but are collected in different surveys. The first step is to subset the data frames so we are working with fewer columns. This is not necessary, but simplifies the analysis.

```{r}
directory <- directory[,c('unitid', 'instnm', 'sector', 'control')]
retention <- retention[,c('unitid', 'ret_pcf', 'ret_pcp')]
admissions <- admissions[,c('unitid', 'admcon1', 'admcon2', 'admcon7', 'applcnm', 
						   'applcnw', 'applcn', 'admssnm', 'admssnw', 'admssn', 
						   'enrlftm', 'enrlftw', 'enrlptm', 'enrlptw', 'enrlt', 
						   'satnum', 'satpct', 'actnum', 'actpct', 'satvr25', 
						   'satvr75', 'satmt25', 'satmt75', 'satwr25', 'satwr75', 
						   'actcm25', 'actcm75', 'acten25', 'acten75', 'actmt25', 
						   'actmt75', 'actwr25', 'actwr75')]
```

## Example: SAT and First Year Retention (converting factors)

Next, we will recode the variables that indicate whether SAT scores are required for admission.

```{r}
admissionsLabels <- c("Required", "Recommended", "Neither requiered nor recommended", 
					 "Do not know", "Not reported", "Not applicable")
admissions$admcon1 <- factor(admissions$admcon1, levels=c(1,2,3,4,-1,-2), 
							labels=admissionsLabels)
admissions$admcon2 <- factor(admissions$admcon2, levels=c(1,2,3,4,-1,-2), 
							labels=admissionsLabels)
admissions$admcon7 <- factor(admissions$admcon7, levels=c(1,2,3,4,-1,-2), 
							labels=admissionsLabels)
```

## Example: SAT and First Year Retention (renaming variables)

Next, rename the variables to more understandable names.

```{r}
names(retention) <- c("unitid", "FullTimeRetentionRate", "PartTimeRetentionRate")
names(admissions) <- c("unitid", "UseHSGPA", "UseHSRank", "UseAdmissionTestScores", 
					  "ApplicantsMen", "ApplicantsWomen", "ApplicantsTotal", 
					  "AdmissionsMen", "AdmissionsWomen", "AdmissionsTotal", 
					  "EnrolledFullTimeMen", "EnrolledFullTimeWomen", 
					  "EnrolledPartTimeMen", "EnrolledPartTimeWomen", 
					  "EnrolledTotal", "NumSATScores", "PercentSATScores", 
					  "NumACTScores", "PercentACTScores", "SATReading25", 
					  "SATReading75", "SATMath25", "SATMath75", "SATWriting25", 
					  "SATWriting75", "ACTComposite25", "ACTComposite75", 
					  "ACTEnglish25", "ACTEnglish75", "ACTMath25", "ACTMath75", 
					  "ACTWriting25", "ACTWriting75")
```

## Example: SAT and First Year Retention (merging)

We need to merge the three data frames to a single data frame. The `merge` function will merge, or join, two data frames on one or more columns. In this example schools that do not appear in all three data will not appear in the final data frame. To control how data frames are merge, see the `all`, `all.x`, and `all.y` parameters of the `merge` function (hint: works like outer joins in SQL).

```{r}
ret <- merge(directory, admissions, by="unitid")
ret <- merge(ret, retention, by="unitid")
```

We will also only use schools that require or recommend admission tests.

```{r}
ret2 <- ret[ret$UseAdmissionTestScores %in% 
		   	c('Required', 'Recommended', 'Neither requiered nor recommended'),] 
```

## Example: SAT and First Year Retention (converting numeric columns)

IPEDS uses periods (`.`) to represent missing values. As a result, R will treat the column as a `character` column so we need to convert them to `numeric` columns. The `as.numeric` function will do this and any value that is not numeric (`.`s in this example) will be treated as missing values (i.e. `NA`).

```{r, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
ret2$SATMath75 <- as.numeric(ret2$SATMath75)
ret2$SATMath25 <- as.numeric(ret2$SATMath25)
ret2$SATWriting75 <- as.numeric(ret2$SATWriting75)
ret2$SATWriting25 <- as.numeric(ret2$SATWriting25)
ret2$NumSATScores <- as.integer(ret2$NumSATScores)
```

## Example: SAT and First Year Retention (calculating)

IPEDS only provides the 25th and 75th percentile in SAT and ACT scores. We will use the mean of these two values as a proxy for the mean.

```{r, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
ret2$SATMath <- (ret2$SATMath75 + ret2$SATMath25) / 2
ret2$SATWriting <- (ret2$SATWriting75 + ret2$SATWriting25) / 2
ret2$SATTotal <- ret2$SATMath + ret2$SATWriting
ret2$AcceptanceTotal <- as.numeric(ret2$AdmissionsTotal) / as.numeric(ret2$ApplicantsTotal)
ret2$UseAdmissionTestScores <- as.factor(as.character(ret2$UseAdmissionTestScores))
```

## Example: SAT and First Year Retention (final data frame)

```{r}
str(ret2)
```

## Miscellaneous Functions

* `paste` and `paste0` - concatenate strings (`paste0` uses `sep=''` by default)  
```{r}
paste('Hello', 'NEAIR!')
```
* `prettyNum` - Formats numbers to strings  
```{r}
prettyNum(123456.987654321, big.mark=',', digits=8)
```


# Statistics ###################################################################

## Descriptive Statistics {.columns-2}

```{r}
mean(tutoring$Age)    # Mean
median(tutoring$Age)  # Median
var(tutoring$Age)     # Variance
sd(tutoring$Age)      # Standard deviation
IQR(tutoring$Age)     # Inter-quartile range
min(tutoring$Age)     # Minimum value
max(tutoring$Age)     # Maximum value
summary(tutoring$Age) # All at once
```

## The `describe` and `describeBy` Functions

The `describe` and `describeBy` functions in the `psych` package are useful for calculating descriptive statistics across many variables.

```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(psych)
describe(tutoring$Age)
describeBy(tutoring$Age, tutoring$Military, mat=TRUE)
```

The `mat=TRUE` parameter presents the results in tabular format that is useful for later converting to a document or report.

## Contingency and Proportion Tables {.columns-2}

```{r}
(tab1 <- table(tutoring$Military, useNA='ifany'))
(tab2 <- table(tutoring$Military, tutoring$treat, 
			   useNA='ifany'))
```

```{r}
prop.table(tab1)
prop.table(tab2)    # Sum of all cells = 1
prop.table(tab2, 1) # Sum of rows = 1
prop.table(tab2, 2) # Sum of columns = 1
```

## Correlation

```{r}
cor(ret2$SATMath, ret2$FullTimeRetentionRate, use='complete.obs')
cor.test(ret2$SATMath, ret2$FullTimeRetentionRate, use='complete.obs')
```

## t-tests

```{r, echo=FALSE, results='hide'}
tutoring$treat2 <- tutoring$treat != 'Control'
```
```{r}
t.test(Grade ~ treat2, data=tutoring)
```

## Regression

The `lm` and `glm` functions are used for linear models and generalized linear models, respectively. The following example is a multiple regression model predicting `FullTimeRetentionRate` from `SATWriting`, `SATMath`, `AcceptanceTotal`, and `UseAdmissionTestScores`.

```{r}
lm.fit = lm(FullTimeRetentionRate ~ SATWriting + SATMath + AcceptanceTotal + 
		 	UseAdmissionTestScores, data=ret2, weights=ret2$NumSATScores)
summary(lm.fit)
```

See [Linear Regression with NYS Report Card](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jbryer/EPSY530Summer2015/master/Slides/LinearRegressionNYSRC.html) for more linear regression.

## Gammar of Graphics with `ggplot2`

* `ggplot2` is an R package that provides an alternative framework based upon Wilkinson’s (2005) Grammar of Graphics.
* `ggplot2` is, in general, more flexible for creating "prettier" and complex plots.
* Works by creating layers of different types of objects/geometries (i.e. bars, points, lines, polygons, etc.)
`ggplot2` has at least three ways of creating plots:
     1. `qplot`
     2. `ggplot(...) + geom_XXX(...) + ...`
     3. `ggplot(...) + layer(...)`
* We will focus only on the second.

## First Example {.flexbox .vcenter}

```{r, fig.width=8, fig.height=4.5}
data(diamonds)
ggplot(diamonds, aes(x=carat, y=price, color=cut)) + geom_point()
```

## Parts of a `ggplot2` Statement

>- Data  
`ggplot(myDataFrame, aes(x=x, y=y)`
>- Layers  
`geom_point()`, `geom_histogram()`
>- Facets  
`facet_wrap(~ cut)`, `facet_grid(~ cut)`
>- Scales  
`scale_y_log10()`
>- Other options  
`ggtitle('my title')`, `ylim(c(0, 10000))`, `xlab('x-axis label')`

## Lots of geoms

```{r}
ls('package:ggplot2')[grep('geom_', ls('package:ggplot2'))]
```

## Histograms {.flexbox .vcenter}

```{r, fig.width=8, fig.height=4.5}

```

## Density Plots {.flexbox .vcenter}

```{r, fig.width=8, fig.height=4.5}
ggplot(tutoring, aes(x=Age)) + geom_density()
```

## Boxplots {.flexbox .vcenter}

```{r, fig.width=3, fig.height=4.5}
ggplot(tutoring, aes(x=Military, y=Age)) + geom_boxplot()
```

## Barplots {.flexbox .vcenter}

```{r, fig.width=8, fig.height=4.5}
ggplot(tutoring, aes(x=Ethnicity)) + geom_bar()
```

## Example: SAT and First Year Retention {.build}

First, we define the data and aesthetics (i.e. the various components for the graph). Here, SAT math scores will be on the x-axis, full-time retention rates on the y-axis. Points will be sized based upon the number of SAT scores included. The color will represent whether admission test scores are required, recommended, or neither required nor recommended.

```{r, warning=FALSE}
p <- ggplot(ret2, aes(x=SATMath, y=FullTimeRetentionRate, size=NumSATScores,
				 color=UseAdmissionTestScores))
```

Next, we define the graphic objects (i.e. `geom`s) to add to the figure.

```{r, warning=FALSE}
p <- p + geom_point()
```

We can override the default color scheme for the points (note the default is `scale_color_hue`).

```{r, warning=FALSE}
p <- p + scale_color_brewer('Test Required for Admissions', type='qual')
```

Lastly, we will add axis labels and a title.

```{r, warning=FALSE}
p <- p + xlab('SAT Math Score') + ylab('Full Time Retention Rate') +
	ggtitle('SAT and Full Time Retention')
```

## Example: SAT and First Year Retention {.flexbox .vcenter}

```{r, warning=FALSE, echo=FALSE, fig.width=8, fig.height=4.5}
p
```

## Example: SAT and First Year Retention {.flexbox .vcenter}

We can easily add additional geoms, here adding a Loess regression line.

```{r, warning=FALSE, fig.width=8, fig.height=4.5}
p + geom_smooth(method='loess')
```

# Document Preparation #########################################################

## Markdown

Markdown is a plan text format designed primarily to be converted to HTML documents. However, with the development of [Pandoc](http://pandoc.org/), markdown has become popular for generating lots of other document formats including PDF, Word, and presentations (this presentation is, in fact, written in markdown).

The goal of markdown is for the source file (in plain text) to be readable without converting to the desired output format.

	# Level 1 Header  
	## Level 2 Header
	### Level 3 Header
	#### Level 4 Header
	##### Level 5 Header

One asterisk around a word or phrase will put it in *italics*, two will make it **bold**.

See https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/ for more on Markdown.


## R Markdown

R markdown extends markdown by allowing for embedding R code and output directly within your document.

<pre class='prettyprint lang-r'>
`r ''````{r Label, options}  
2 + 2
```
</pre>

R code can also be included inline by placing commands between `` ` r  `` and `` ` `` (note: not space between the opening tickmark and `r`).

<pre class='prettyprint lang-r'>
A total of ` r nrow(mass)` students responded to the survey.
</pre>

A total of `r nrow(mass)` students responded to the survey.

See https://www.rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/rmarkdown-cheatsheet.pdf for a cheat sheet on markdown and R markdown.


## Chunk Options

* `eval` (`TRUE` or `FALSE`) - whether the chunk is executed.
* `echo` (`TRUE` or `FALSE`) - whether the source code is copied into the final document.
* `message` (`TRUE` or `FALSE`) - whether messages are included in the final document.
* `warning` (`TRUE` or `FALSE`) - whether warning messages are included in the final document.
* `results` (`asis`, `hide`) - how the output should be included.
* `fig.width` - the width of any figures from the code chunk.
* `fig.height` - the height of any figures from the code chunk.
* `cache` - whether the R chunk should be cached and only updated if changed. Useful if the chunk takes a significant amount of time to run.

## Tables

```{r}
library(knitr)
tab <- describeBy(tutoring$Grade, group=tutoring$treat, mat=TRUE, skew=FALSE)
tab <- tab[,c('group1', 'n', 'mean', 'sd', 'median')]
names(tab) <- c('Treatment', 'n', 'Mean', 'Standard Deviation', 'Median')
kable(tab, row.names=FALSE, digits=3, caption='Descriptive Statistics for Grade by Treatment')
```

## Math Equations

<img src='DaumScreen.png' width='600' alt='Daum Editor Screenshot' align='right'>

R Markdown uses [MathJax](https://www.mathjax.org/) to display math equations. MathJax is an open source JavaScript library that converts LaTeX style equations to HTML. Thanks to Daum Equation Editor available as a [Google Chrome Extension](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=1&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=0CB4QFjAAahUKEwifg8qolurIAhXI6CYKHWqzBUE&url=https%3A%2F%2Fchrome.google.com%2Fwebstore%2Fdetail%2Fdaum-equation-editor%2Fdinfmiceliiomokeofbocegmacmagjhe%3Fhl%3Den&usg=AFQjCNHN4YwIK4t7cZnjtAURGPzFadCONQ&sig2=Lvsf0JzDQFCECAoMIYIo8A) or as a [Mac Application](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=3&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=0CDAQFjACahUKEwifg8qolurIAhXI6CYKHWqzBUE&url=https%3A%2F%2Fitunes.apple.com%2Fus%2Fapp%2Fdaum-equation-editor%2Fid540665783%3Fmt%3D12&usg=AFQjCNH69beGYAfr5ojnPILLNOG-goN9sw&sig2=MwUV_3iF8zb0BQDNL7sBgQ), creating equations is relatively simply using a graphical user interface. Math equations are surrounded by one dollar sign for inline equations or two dollar signs for centered equations.
